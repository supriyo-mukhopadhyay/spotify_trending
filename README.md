## Project

'''
As a Data Engineer, I worked on collecting and analyzing the latest song releases and streaming trends from Spotify to identify the most trending songs globally. The project involved extracting real-time music chart data, and generating analytical reports to highlight current listening trends and audience preferences.
'''

## Project

1. Web scraping
2. Preparing data for analytical studies
3. Automated system to handle authentication timeouts (example: http/https 429 error)
4. AWS glueetl to execute request urls
5. Create dynamic dataframes using SparkContext and GlueContext and write dynamic data frames into s3
